# Comp10001 Tutes Notes

A list of Notes/Handouts for Comp10001 at Unimelb

## Weekly Notes/Handouts
Handouts can be found [Here](https://github.com/PhalanxHead/Comp101Tutes/wiki)

## Tutorial Plan
Ideally from now on, I want to run the first half as a "What was done in class" thing, and the second as a "Let's build something cool" thing. What this means is, ideally I need you guys to be caught up on lectures and/or ahead in grok sheets so we get time to talk about the cool stuff.

## Handy notes for Uni and Beyond
1. The University gives you a heap of free stuff online, including, but not limited to:
  - Free Microsoft Office 365 (and mine hasn't run out yet so use it)
  - Free GitHub Premium, including a GitKraken Pro license (This is good for future project work, and hopefully we will use it this sem)
  - A Lucidchart License, so you can make pretty charts of doggos
  - Free Windows Licenses. Like a shittonne of em.
  - Free Matlab licenses.
  - Seriously, just try your uni login on whatever site you want and there's a 50/50 you'll get it.
  
2. Networking (as in meeting people) is, while not essentially, a good skill, and it takes a while to learn.

I suggest that use your uni time to learn how to talk to people you don't know, because it's not fun to learn after uni.
Don't forget that you're not just at uni/college to make connections though.

3. Here's a list of handy skills to learn while you have the time:
  - Git
  - LaTeX
  - Writimg Documentation
  - C# and Entity Framework
  - Javascripy and Angular
  - Bash
  - Docker
  
None of these are taught well at uni, but they're essential to making things (mostly).

4. JOIN A CLUB AND GO TO EVENTS

Melb Uni PotterHeads and Cosmic Hitchikers' Appreciation Society are both good. Tabletop club is also really fun.
The Cheese club is pretty good too.

5. Subscribe to TheRegister.co.uk and other reputable tech news.

The Register is a mostly-security-based newspaper that reports on dumb-stuff-companies-did. It's pretty funny, and will inform you of what's going on in the cyber-sec world -- and that affects all of us.
It's free, they send you an email once a week, 100% worth.

6. Use a Password Manager.

They're not that expensive. They'll save you time and headaches. I use 1Password, it's pretty good.

7. Come to Tutes. Pls
